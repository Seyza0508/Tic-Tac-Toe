# Tic-Tac-Toe
File 1 (TicTacToe.py):
This script defines a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI). It creates a tkinter window, allowing two players to take turns making moves. The game logic checks for victories, draws and handles resets. When the game ends, it displays a message box indicating the result (win or draw).

File 2 (TicTacToeAI.py):
This script extends the previous Tic Tac Toe game by adding an AI opponent with selectable difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). The AI opponent, 'O,' uses different strategies to make moves based on the selected difficulty level. The game continues until there is a win or a draw, displaying a message box with the outcome. The AI opponent implements a basic AI strategy in the "easy" and "medium" levels and a more advanced minimax algorithm in the "hard" level to make optimal moves.

Both scripts share common elements, including a tkinter-based GUI, game logic for tracking moves and checking for wins/draws, and a reset function to start a new game. The "TicTacToeAI.py" script enhances the game by introducing AI gameplay and difficulty levels.
